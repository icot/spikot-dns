*** DNS Message Format. TCP Illustrated v1 p520

 - 12 byte header
   - 0-1: Transaction ID: Set by client, returned by server
   - 2-3: Flags
     - QR: Query(0)/Response(1)
     - OpCode (4bits)
       - Query (0)
       - Notify (4) DNS NOTIFY (RFC1996)
       - Update (5) DNS Update (RFC2136)
     - AA: Authoritative Answer
     - TC: Truncated Answer (UDP: Total size of the reply > 512 bytes, only 1st part returned)
     - RD: Recursion Desired
     - RA: REcursion Available
     - Z: Zero
     - AD: Authentic Data (RFC4035)
     - CD: Checking Disabled (RFC4035)
     - RCODE (4bits) (RFC 1035 (0-5), RFC 2136 (6-10))
       - 0 NoError
       - 1 FormErr - Format Error
       - 2 ServFail - Server Failure
       - 3 NXDomain - Non-existent Domain
       - 4 NotImp - Not Implemented
       - 5 Refused - Query Refused
       - 6 YXDomain - Name exists but should not (updates)
       - 7 YXRRSet - RRSet exists but should not (updates)
       - 8 NXRRSet - RRSet does not exist but should (updates)
       - 9 NotAuth - Server not authorized for zone (updates)
       - 10 NotZone - Name not contained in zone (updates)
   - 4-5: QDCOUNT/ZOCOUNT (Query Count/ Zone Count)
   - 6-7: ANCOUNT/PRCOUNT (Answer Count/ Prerequisite Count)
   - 8-9: NSCOUNT/UPCOUNT (Authority Record Count/ Update Count)
   - 10-11: ARCOUNT/ADCOUNT (Additional information Count)
 - Four variable length sections:
   - questions/queries
   - answers (resource records - RR)
   - authority records (RR)
   - additional information (RR)
 + Sections used with DNS Update
   - Zone
   - Prerequisite
   - Update
   - Additional Information

*** Questions/RRs
  - name (sequence of labels)
    - labels
      - Data [1-byte length, b1, b2, b3, 1-byte length, b4, ..., 0]
        - length <= 63
        - RFC1035: labels “start with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and have as interior characters only letters, digits and hyphen.”
        - Could contain unicode, although not recommended (RFC5890, RFC5891)
      - Compression labels
        - If the length byte for a label has a value over 192, the 6 less significant bits are joined
        with the 8 bits of the next byte to write a 14-bit offset pointer from the begging of the DNS message towards
        a data label which while be used in place

*** DNS Extension format (EDNS0 RFC2671), required for DNSSEC

  Specifies an additional type of RR: OPT pseudo-RR or meta-RR, added to the additional data section.
  If this is included in UDP messages, it's permitted to exceed 512 bytes and might add additional error codes

  Defines extended labels, which have the first two bits of the label Type/Length set to 01, so use values
  between 64 and 127.

*** UDP vs TCP

 [ 20 bytes IPv4 Header | UDP Header 8 bytes | DNS Fixed Header 12 bytes | Sections: Variable size ]
                                             <--------------     512 bytes       ------------------>

 TCP DNS request (RFC5966) issued after UDP fails with TC set to 1 (truncated)

*** Query/Zone Section Format

  [ Query Name (variable), data labels | Query type (16 bits) | Query class (16 bits) ]

  Class: 1 (Internet class), 254 (no class), 255 (all classes) (RFC 6195)
  Type: A, ANY

*** Resource Record format

  [ Name (varible) | Type (16 bits) | Class (16 bits) | TTL (32 bits) | RDLENGTH (16 bits | RDATA (variable) ]

** Usage

- Open terminal

#+begin_src
 cd roswell
 ./spikot-dns.ros
#+end_src

- Second terminal session

#+begin_src
λ nslookup -port=1053 www.google.com 127.0.0.1
;; Warning: query response not set
Server:		127.0.0.1
Address:	127.0.0.1#1053

Non-authoritative answer:
;; Warning: query response not set
 Can't find www.google.com: No answer
 #+end_src

- Display via stdout in first terminal
#+begin_src
